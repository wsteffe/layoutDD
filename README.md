# layoutDD

This package is aimed to the Domain Decomposition of PCB circuits exported by EDA software.
The most used filre format for the definition of PCB sytructure is ODB++ but unfortunately an open source reader 
of ODB++ format is not yet available so I decided to import the layout geometry from dxf and gdsii files.
The Test folder of this project includes a dxf file, a gds file and a layer map file generated by Keysight ADS code
after having imported the circuit originally given in the ODB++ format.

There is a redundancy in this set of exported data because the geometrical shapes are described in gds file and also in
the dxf file. Buy the two description are nor equivalent:

* The dxf format allows a precise definition of curved shapes such as circles, ellipses, spline curves but there is a drawback. Sometimes, when the layout is very complicate, klayout may fail to reconstruct the regions covered by a layer from the dxf representation.

* The gds format offers a more reliable identification of inner regions but all curved shapes are discretized into polygonal shapes. Another drawback of the gds format is that it doesn't retain the layer names which are instead identified with integer indices (and an integer data type). The third file (the layer map file) exported by Keysight ADS is meant to establish a biunivocal map between these integer indices and the layer names.

The polygonal representation allows a fast implementation of several operations acting on planar shapes like union, intersection and others. The polygonal approximation is surely justified in the design of integrated circuits, which is the main applocation area of the klayoout code. There are other applications (in example the design of RF circuits on PCBs) in which it is important to preserve a precise representation of the curved shapes. In principle a high geometrical accuracy can also be achieved trough a very fine discretization but this approach is not recommanded when the planar structure has to be imported in an electromagnetic solver based on FEM (the finite element method). In fact the fine discretization may lead to very dense tetrahedral meshes with a strong penalitization of the simulation times. It is much better to pass the exact shapes to the electromagnetic solver which may then apply an adaptive refinement process with a great improvements of the numerical efficiency.


LayoutDD package uses the gds file to identify the layer regions but it extracts the geometry inserted in a subdomain from the dxf file so that the original curved shapes are not lost.
A fourth file (the stack file) is required by layoutDD for the definition of the stackup associated with the PCB circuits.
Currently the stack file must be edited by the user which has to specify the z extent (minumum and maximum z coordinate) associated with each
dielectric and each metal layers included in the PCB structure. The format is the following:


>   layerName1: type1 Zmin1 Zmax1 operation1 oporder1

>   layerName2: type2 Zmin2 Zmax2 operation2 oporder2

>   ...

> type can be:

>     DIEL  for a dielectric layer

> 	  BC    for a metal layer or for via holes

> 	  WGP   for layer definiong waveguide ports

> oporder is the sequential order of associated operarion

> operation can be

>     add   generates a solid extrusion from Zmin to Zmax

> 	  ins   generates a solid extrusion from Zmin to Zmax which is inserted into solids generated by operations with lower order

> 	  hsurf generates an horizontal surface filling the layer region on plane z=Zmin

>     vsurf generates a surface extrusion from Zmin to Zmax


A minimal operation sequence is:

  * Create a technology and set the related dxf_unit as required for a proper reading of the dxf file. Set this technology in the GUI selector
  * Open the gds file with the normal open command in Klayout File menu.
  * Use command Import Layout from layoutDD menu
  * Use command New Region from layoutDD menu and fill the form with Zmin, Zmax values associated with the new subdomain.
  * Select layer 0 of new created cell named Region_1.and draw a closed polygon on this layer. 
  * Use command Make Subdomain from layoutDD menu.
  
  A new file named "Region_1.FCStd" is generated in the project Subfolder named "Subdomains".
  This document contains a 3D model of the extracted geometry which can be openeed with the FreeCAD Softewaare available at https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases.
  The geometrical elements are all hidden once the document is opened in the FC code. 
  The visibility and a better color setting can be established with the macro setPCBvisibility.py (available from the subfolder python/FCmacro) 
  invoked from the Macro menu of FC software.
